# Hello there, I'm Nizaam! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the repo of my Portfolio Website. This project was written with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## About this project
Every developer needs to have some way of viewing their portfolio. This, is mine. It will forever be evolving as I learn and grow. So look forward to that :)

## Viewing my Portfolio Website

In the About section of the repo, you'll see a link to the Live Version of the website. If there are issues viewing that version, feel free to use the Alternative version below.

[Alternative Version](https://portfolio-website-sigma-orcin.vercel.app)

### Run Locally
If for some reason, you are unable to view the alternative version, you may clone this repo and run it via Visual Studio Code or any editor of your choice that may support live viewing of HTML content.

### For VS Code users

Download the Live Server extension and click "Go Live"
