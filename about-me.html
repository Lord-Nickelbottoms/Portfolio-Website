                <h1>What makes me, Me</h1>

                <p>My favourite Superhero is Spider-Man. Why? Well all Spider-People throughtout the Spider-Verse are the type of the people that always perseveres regardless of how bleak any situation may seem. A characteristic that I continue to apply when it comes to any task.</p>

                <p>As a Software Engineer and Gamer, I always find situations in which I face an obstacle and need to apply my learning and skills to overcome the problem to proceed further into the game or project. No matter how much I struggle and face Imposter Syndrome, I am bound to beat the challenge.</p>

                <p>One of the major skills a Software Engineer should always have, is Communication. I used to be an extremely shy person who would rather hide in the shadows, but struggling during coding is where I was taught and experienced that communicating one's problem or need for guidance is always a net benefit.</p>
